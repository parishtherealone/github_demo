Attached a new improvised image classification model, which used Transfer learning, updated from the previously stored model in the same repository.

CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Transfer Learning

The training dataset was split into:
90% Training Data
10% Validation Data
Validation performance was monitored while training the model to prevent overfitting and ensure good generalization.

Metrics Reported:
Model performance was evaluated using
          Training Accuracy
          Validation Accuracy
          Test Accuracy

Model accuracy ~ 84%

Now the Improvised Model runs quite faster then the classic CNN model
